# General

In this work, we address the task of predicting if an individual is earning 50K or more a year. It is a binary classification problem.
This work is a part of an in-class [Kaggle Competition for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs5228) Course offered at NUS, Singapore in Semester 2 of AY 2019-2020.

Our final binary F1-score is 86,946\% on the private leaderboard and we were ranked 10th / 55.

# Data description, exploration and visualisation

The Kaggle dataset consists of a separate training and test dataset, both consisting of 24,421 records each. 
The training dataset suffers from class imbalance, with 75.15\% of the samples being from the negative class (â‰¤ \$50K, label=0) and the remaining 24.85\% being positive samples (> \$50K, label=1).
The dataset consists of 13 attributes described below:
